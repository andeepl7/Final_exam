Hamming code is a type of error-correcting code that is widely used in digital communication systems to detect and correct errors in transmitted data. It was invented by Richard Hamming in 1950 and is named after him. Hamming code works by adding redundant bits to the data being transmitted, called parity bits, which can be used to detect and correct errors. If any single bit in the transmitted data is flipped due to noise or other interference, the receiver can use the parity bits to determine the location of the error and correct it. Hamming code is simple yet effective and has played a crucial role in the development of reliable digital communication systems.
